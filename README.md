Falcon 9 First-Stage Landing Prediction – Capstone Project
Project Overview

This project analyzes historical SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data to predict first-stage landing success using data analysis, visualization, and machine learning classification models.

Repository Structure

API Lab 1.ipynb – Data collection using SpaceX REST API

API Lab 2.ipynb – Web scraping landing outcome data

API Lab 3.ipynb – Data wrangling and preprocessing

API Lab 4.ipynb – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization

API Lab 5.ipynb – SQL-based exploratory analysis

API Lab 6.ipynb – Predictive analysis using ML models

Methodology

Collected data via SpaceX API and web scraping

Cleaned and processed data for analysis

Performed EDA using SQL and visualizations

Built interactive maps (Folium) and dashboards (Plotly Dash)

Trained and evaluated Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM models

Results

Landing success depends on payload mass, orbit type, launch site, and flight number

SVM achieved the highest accuracy

Model reliably predicts landing success for cost estimation

Tools & Technologies

Python • Pandas • SQL • Matplotlib • Seaborn • Folium • Plotly Dash • Scikit-learn

Usage

Run notebooks in order (API Lab 1 → API Lab 6) to reproduce the full analysis and results.
